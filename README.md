# Agent-Based-Modeling-Final-Project
Final Project for DATA201- Agent Based Modeling. I created a Firm-Worker Agent Based Model meant to simulate a perfecto economy job market


This project contains two different scripts.

The first script is the final version of the ABM which contains all of the methods used to create the job market simulation.

The other script is the calibration which takes data that was gathered through a Kaggle repository and uses said data to calibrate the model to real world data.

The data is also included as a reference as well.
